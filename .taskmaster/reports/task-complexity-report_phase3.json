			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Create Phase 3 Database Schema",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the schema creation into subtasks for each table (parental_consents, device_flags, tutoring_sessions, weekly_recaps, achievements), including migration writing, index addition, and schema updates.",
			"reasoning": "Involves multiple new tables, indexes, and schema updates with dependencies on existing structures; moderate effort due to Ecto migration specifics and testing for constraints."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Trust & Safety Agent",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into subtasks for GenServer setup, each check function (blocklist, rate limits, etc.), client API, server callbacks, and integration with Repo.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to multiple fraud detection and compliance checks, state management, error handling, and integration with database; requires thorough testing for security."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Session Intelligence Pipeline",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Subtasks for Oban worker setup, transcription stubbing, Claude API integration, action generation, and TrustSafety integration.",
			"reasoning": "Complex due to external API calls (Claude), JSON parsing, database updates, and event triggering; high testing needs for mocks and edge cases."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Proud Parent Loop",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into subtasks for module functions (generate, handle_join, complete_signup), progress reel/email generation, and integrations (MCP, Attribution, Analytics).",
			"reasoning": "Involves multiple integrations and privacy handling; moderate to high effort with dependencies on other modules."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Tutor Spotlight Loop",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Subtasks for module functions, share pack generation, link handling (WhatsApp/SMS/Email), and reward/analytics integration.",
			"reasoning": "Similar to Proud Parent, with focus on tutor profiles and feedback; requires careful handling of sharing mechanisms."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Weekly Recap Generator Job",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Subtasks for Oban worker implementation and recap generation logic, including scheduling and event triggering.",
			"reasoning": "Depends on database queries and triggering loops; moderate complexity with testing for data accuracy."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Add Compliance Middleware",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Subtasks for plug creation and router integration, including error handling and context extraction.",
			"reasoning": "Straightforward Phoenix plug with TrustSafety calls; lower complexity but critical for compliance."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Deploy Phase 3 Agents and Jobs",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Subtasks for MCP deployment setup and Orchestrator updates, including scheduling and testing in staging.",
			"reasoning": "Deployment-focused with configuration; lower technical complexity but requires careful staging."

			"taskTitle": "Implement Phase 3 Integration Tests",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Subtasks for tests on each module (TrustSafety, Session Pipeline, loops), including mocks and CI/CD integration.",
			"reasoning": "Comprehensive testing across multiple components; high effort for coverage and edge cases."

			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Subtasks for LiveView setup and metrics fetching/display, including real-time updates.",
			"reasoning": "UI-focused with data fetching; moderate effort, low priority as per task."
