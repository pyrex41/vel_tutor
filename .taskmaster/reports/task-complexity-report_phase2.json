		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Create Phase 2 Database Migrations",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "",
			"reasoning": "This task involves standard database migration work using Ecto, with clear specifications for tables, indexes, and constraints. It has low technical challenges, minimal dependencies, and straightforward testing via SQL queries, making it moderately complex but not requiring subtasks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Personalization Agent",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Personalization Agent implementation into subtasks for defining the GenServer module structure, implementing API integration with Claude and fallbacks, and adding logging and error handling.",
			"reasoning": "Implementing a GenServer with external API calls, state management, and fallback logic introduces concurrency challenges and integration testing needs. Dependencies on migrations add some risk, justifying a higher score and subtasks for modular development."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Incentives & Economy Agent",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the Incentives & Economy Agent into subtasks for GenServer setup and state management, core reward logic implementation, and integration with database for balances and caps.",
			"reasoning": "Similar to task 2, this requires GenServer for thread-safety, complex logic for caps and redemptions, and database integration. Testing concurrency increases effort, warranting subtasks for focused implementation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Enhance Orchestrator with Loop Routing",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split the Orchestrator enhancement into subtasks for adding loop routing logic and integrating throttling and scoring mechanisms.",
			"reasoning": "Modifying an existing agent to include new features like eligibility checks and MCP integration adds moderate complexity. Dependencies on agents 2 and 3 mean integration testing is key, but the task is manageable without extensive subtasks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Buddy Challenge Loop",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Buddy Challenge Loop into subtasks for challenge generation, join handling, completion logic, and integration with personalization and rewards.",
			"reasoning": "This loop involves multiple integrations (Attribution, MCP, Analytics), complex flows for decks and sessions, and end-to-end testing. High dependencies and technical challenges in real-time interactions push complexity up, requiring subtasks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Results Rally Loop",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the Results Rally Loop into subtasks for leaderboard fetching and ranking, share pack generation, widget rendering, and real-time presence integration.",
			"reasoning": "Comparable to task 5, with integrations for leaderboards, Presence, and Attribution. Async sharing and real-time updates add concurrency and testing challenges, necessitating subtasks for thorough implementation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Create MCP Deployment Script",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "",
			"reasoning": "Writing a deployment script with specific commands and configurations is straightforward scripting work. Low technical challenges, with testing via dry-runs, and no need for subtasks as it's a single deliverable."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Write Phase 2 Integration Tests",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Separate the integration tests into subtasks for testing Buddy Challenge flows and Results Rally flows, including data setup and assertions.",
			"reasoning": "Creating comprehensive tests for complex loops requires understanding multiple integrations and flows. While not highly technical, the breadth of coverage and dependencies make it moderately complex, with subtasks for organized test writing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Build Phase 2 Metrics Dashboard",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 1,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the dashboard into subtasks for implementing the LiveView render function and adding real-time updates.",
			"reasoning": "Developing a LiveView dashboard involves UI rendering and periodic updates, with moderate effort in metric fetching. Dependencies are light, and testing is manual, keeping complexity medium and subtasks minimal."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Execute Deployment Checklist and Verify Success Criteria",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the deployment execution into subtasks for initial deployment and testing, load testing and metrics verification, and iteration on issues.",
			"reasoning": "This operational task depends on all others, involving deployment, testing, and monitoring over time. High priority and potential for issues (e.g., achieving K-factors) add complexity, requiring subtasks for phased execution."
